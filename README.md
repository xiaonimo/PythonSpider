It is just a simple spider on 'www.qiushibaike.com' for jokes
And it can save the jokes in a .txt file
Remember if the Html code of the website is changed ,the rule to get the joke shoud be changed.

The qb_jokes_queue.py find the urls in the current page, not change the urls automatcally like qb_jokes_page.py
